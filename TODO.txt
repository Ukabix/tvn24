feature1 - clean up browser.pause,implement more cases
feature2 - goes pretty well, email verifcation, implement more cases, link with feature1 to validate account creation // SOME PROBLEMS - seems like useValidationEmail and changeWindowToEmailServicePage are causing them


milestones:
get all features to at least workable state
add Allure reports
refactor!
add mobile handling (chrome capabilities)
add more assertions when tcs are workable
use testing techniques to at least cover most test cases
add screenshots on failed tests
add selenium-standalone and multi-browser support? if time permits
use more helpers? if time permits
change commonJS into ES6...

Oh God, so much to do...
